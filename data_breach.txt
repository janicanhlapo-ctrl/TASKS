1. What do you think the risk is for individuals when their email addresses and passwords are exposed to the public? 
	The risks for individuals are very high when their email addresses and passwords are exposed to the public. 
	Looking at the CIA triad, this exposure will affect and be a threat to confidentiality, integrity and availability as attackers can take over accounts, 
	steal personal or financial/health information, and even use this information to break into several sites especially if the same the password is reused on several sites/service.
	 - This is a huge threat to as the criminal would be managing/taking over the individual’s digital identities. Once they are inside, 
	   they can change passwords, change security questions thereby locking the real owner out. They can also access sensitive information 
	   such as online banking, cloud services, social media accounts as well as personal email accounts. 
	- There could be financial loss which is a major motivation on cyber-attacks. The criminal will be able to access and change credentials 
	  on their banking apps; this would lead to theft of funds, opening loans or accessing saved credit card details and the individual would
	  be unable to access or stop the theft through their banking app. 
	- There will also be data privacy breaches where the criminal will have access to other personal and sensitive information related to an individual’s health as well. 
	- The individual would also be a major target for email scams, phishing if the criminal notices that the email address is active on certain websites/services. 
	  The criminal would be able to use the stolen information to build trust, create urgency while using social engineering to trick the individual into supplying 
	  more data or even downloading malware. 
	- The individual can be exposed to financial malware which is a cyber-dependent attack. The criminal can send malware attachments and even fake login pages 


2. Name two actions you can take to protect yourself against the risks associated with data breaches.
  - Scan you system and ensure that you update your antivirus software frequently. Scanning your sytems for malware is helpful even though an attack may not be detected 
   as malware is often designed to evade antivirus applications. So, when choosing an anti-virus packaage one has to take into consideration their needs.
   - One has to be aware of social engineering and system anomalies. By developing one's social engineering, you will be able to protect your information as you would need to 
   always be alert to tactics that a cyber criminal may use i.e. the use of urgency, trust and even emotional manipulating one to provide sensitive information or even downloading
   a maliscious file. And also pay attention to your computer's performance or even changes to your browser's homepage.
